# Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization using ROS and Gazebo

This project utilizes the ROS AMCL package to accurately localize a mobile robot inside a map in a Gazebo simulation environment.

Developed as part of the Robotics Software Engineer Nanodegree from Udacity.

### Technologies & tools used
 - ROS Kinetic
 - Gazebo
 - ROS AMCL and Navigation stack
 - RViz
